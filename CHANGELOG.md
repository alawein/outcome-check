# Changelog

## 0.4.0 - Unreleased

- Add schema v3 with explicit RFC8785 signature profile, finite binary64 serialization,
  UTF-16 ordering, bound metadata, unsigned migration and required signed re-signing.
- Preserve legacy signature bytes and v1/v2 comparison behavior.
- Add an executable full-state study protocol with honest missing-input coverage.
- Retain one canonical release build, attest and distribute the same verified bytes.
- Add shared output conformance vectors and reconcile published v0.3.0 documentation.

## 0.3.0 - 2026-10-08

- Opt-in version 2 checks: numeric ranges, typed array contains, bounded fixed-width
  regex and explicit baseline comparisons. Unchanged satisfied targets requiring a
  change return unconfirmed. Original version 1 packets/reports stay compatible.
- Optional Ed25519 signatures verified against local public keys, with unsigned and
  unverified labels, required signature enforcement and restricted canonical JSON.
  Signatures authenticate supplied bytes only; core remains dependency-free.
- Per-file atomic report output with hard-link alias and competing-creation guards.
- Versioned Draft 2020-12 schemas, negative/compatibility tests, Hypothesis freshness
  properties, local runtime boundary proof and source type checks.
- Python support floor lowered to 3.11 after local compatibility verification.

## 0.2.0

- Structured HTML viewer: per-requirement table with action receipt, outcome, status,
  reason, expected path/value, observed value, and observed age versus max age.
- How-to-read legend separating action receipts from outcomes and confirmed, unobserved,
  and contradicted meanings. Comparison math, core reasons, and report.json bytes unchanged.
- Row-index context in contract validation messages; CLI --help with packet shape, example
  command, exit codes, and doc pointers. HTML evidence is escaped and large states truncate
  with an explicit marker.

## 0.1.2

- Regenerate committed example report hashes from the canonical LF input files.
- Add a regression comparing the full committed JSON snapshot with actual CLI output.
- Runtime behavior and original immutable v0.1.0 release are unchanged.

## 0.1.1 (tag only, no release)

- A release command continued after a blocked PR merge and created this immutable
  tag on the unchanged v0.1.0 commit. No v0.1.1 package was published.
- Use v0.1.2 for the corrected example snapshot. The tag is retained unchanged.

## 0.1.0

- Read-only explicit action/outcome checks over supplied evidence.
- Exact fractional freshness, typed JSON equality and safe reports.
- Synthetic examples, independently specified tests and GitHub-only distribution.
