# Packet and report contracts

## Compatibility

v0.3.0 accepts original schema_version 1 packets without modification. Their
comparison behavior, result fields and report bytes remain unchanged. Version 2
is opt-in with schema_version 2 and a baselines array (empty is allowed). Never
silently reinterpret a v1 packet as requiring an action-caused change.

Versioned [JSON Schemas](../schemas) use Draft 2020-12 for packets, individual
requirements/observations, baselines and reports. Run
`uv run python scripts/validate_schemas.py` to check all committed contract examples.
Runtime validation additionally enforces unique IDs, exact Python integer types,
finite numbers, calendar validity, nesting depth, regex safety and cross-record
relationships. JSON Schema alone cannot prove evidence truth or those relationships.

## Version 1

Exact root fields: schema_version (integer 1), as_of (timezone-aware RFC3339),
requirements (nonempty array), actions (array), observations (array). Each array
<= 10,000, IDs unique per array. IDs, subjects and object keys are nonblank strings
<= 200 characters. Files UTF-8 without BOM, <= 5 MiB; duplicate JSON keys invalid.

Requirement exact fields: id, subject, path (1..32 object-key strings), expected
(JSON value, recursive depth <= 32), observation_id, max_age_seconds (nonnegative
integer, Boolean forbidden), action_id (ID or null). Observation exact fields:
id, subject, observed_at (RFC3339), state (JSON object). Action exact fields:
id, status (succeeded|failed|unknown). Unknown fields and nonfinite numbers fail.

Missing references are unobserved. Only the named observation is checked. Its
subject must match and age must be in [0,max_age_seconds] relative to as_of.
Missing object paths are unobserved. Equality is recursive and typed, except
integer/float numeric equivalence. No array indexing, expressions or collectors.

Action: succeeded=>confirmed, failed=>contradicted, unknown/missing=>unobserved,
null=>not_required. Overall contradicted if either required component contradicted;
confirmed if outcome confirmed and action confirmed/not_required; otherwise
unobserved. Reports show both components and an outcome reason. No clock lookup.
Output schema_version 1, counts, results, exit_code and exact input SHA-256.

Offset hours 00..23/minutes 00..59 are enforced. Fractional-second freshness uses
every supplied digit. Leap seconds and year 0000 are unsupported by the calendar
parser and rejected. Timestamp strings are limited to 64 characters.

## Version 2 checks and baseline evidence

Root adds required baselines and optional require_signatures (Boolean, default
false). Baseline rows have the same shape as observations. ID uniqueness is per
array, with explicit baseline_id references into baselines. Requirements retain
all v1 fields and optionally add check (default equal), baseline_id and
requires_change (Boolean, default false). Even baseline-only checks retain expected
for a stable requirement shape; that field is ignored by those two check types.

- equal: the original recursive typed equality.
- range: expected is an object with min and/or max, each a finite number; optional
  min_inclusive/max_inclusive are Booleans and default true. An inclusivity flag
  needs its matching bound. Reversed bounds are invalid. Observed Booleans and
  nonnumbers contradict the check. Numbers need no float subtraction.
- contains: observed value must be an array with at least one member equal to
  expected under typed recursive equality. Objects, substrings and array indices
  are not membership checks.
- regex: expected is the restricted pattern described below; observed value must
  be a string of at most 4096 characters. Uses fullmatch, including at newline
  boundaries. Wrong types or oversized observations contradict the check.
- unchanged / changed_from_baseline: require baseline_id and compare the addressed
  value to that baseline using typed equality. They respectively confirm equality
  or inequality. unchanged conflicts with requires_change=true and is rejected.

A selected baseline must match the subject, contain the same object path and
strictly precede the selected final observation. A missing or incompatible baseline
is unobserved, never confirmed. No baseline age threshold is inferred from final
max_age_seconds. Its preaction provenance is supplied by the caller: the tool has
no action clock or collector and cannot establish when an action occurred.

For an otherwise satisfied equal/range/contains/regex check with requires_change=true,
an unchanged addressed value returns outcome and status unconfirmed with reason
`no observed change`. Failed action still makes overall status contradicted.
Different state can satisfy a change check without proving which action caused it.
A caller must choose requires_change only when change is actually required; a correct
refusal or deliberately unchanged state may be the legitimate target.

Version 2 reports add counts.unconfirmed and each result's signature label. Exit 0
means all requirements confirmed, exit 1 includes unconfirmed, unobserved or
contradicted results; exit 2 means invalid input/I/O. Readers restricted to three
statuses must migrate before adopting version 2. Version 1 reports keep three counts.

## Restricted regex safety

Patterns are 2..256 ASCII characters, anchored with ^ and $. The body permits
ASCII letters/digits and literal space, underscore, hyphen, colon, slash, comma,
at sign. Bracket classes contain only ASCII letters/digits, spaces, underscore,
hyphen and valid ranges. Escapes permit only literal `. - _ ^ $ [ ] { }` and
backslash. Each atom may have one fixed `{n}` repetition with 1<=n<=128; the total
expanded width is <=4096. Empty bodies are allowed. Examples: `^ok$`,
`^[A-Z]{2}[0-9]{2}$`, `^v[0-9]\\.[0-9]$` (JSON requires escaped backslashes).

Alternation, groups, lookarounds, backreferences, wildcard dots, shorthand classes,
unbounded quantifiers, variable repetitions and flags are rejected. The stdlib
engine receives only a fixed-width sequence of literals/classes: it has no choices
of repetition length or alternative branch. This bounds complexity by construction;
there is no timeout API or timeout guarantee. Arbitrary regular expressions are not
supported, and rejection is an input error rather than a silently changed pattern.

## Optional signatures

Observation/baseline signature is an object with exact fields algorithm (Ed25519),
key_id (ID), signature (base64, <=128 characters, decoded length exactly 64).
Unsigned observations are labeled unsigned and remain usable unless
require_signatures=true. Supplied signatures without a verifier are unverified.
A verified signature proves the supplied bytes match a locally supplied public key,
not truthful state, collector accuracy, freshness in the real world or action cause.
Invalid signatures cannot confirm a check. Missing/unverified signatures cannot
confirm when require_signatures=true; the same rule applies to selected baselines.

`check_packet(packet, verifier=None)` accepts the SignatureVerifier protocol from
outcome_check.signatures. Verifiers are trusted local application code, not executable
plugins loaded from packet data. The provided Ed25519Verifier accepts a mapping of
key IDs to raw 32-byte public keys and never downloads keys. Install the signing
extra for cryptography; default core has zero dependencies. Optional sign_observation
returns a new row from a raw local private key; it never writes or persists that key.

CLI `--public-keys keys.json` reads a local JSON object mapping key IDs to base64
32-byte public keys. Duplicate keys, malformed key IDs, bad encoding and input over
5 MiB fail. Key files are read-only inputs and cannot alias a report output. Keys are
not secrets; the CLI has no private-key or signing option.

Payload is canonical JSON of the complete observation excluding signature, plus
algorithm and key_id at its top level. Canonicalization implements only this RFC 8785
subset: null, Boolean, strings without lone surrogates, arrays, objects sorted by
UTF-16 code units, and safe integers [-9007199254740991,9007199254740991]. Strings
use JSON control escaping and UTF-8 without normalization. Floats, larger integers
and lone surrogates are rejected for signing/verification. This is not full RFC 8785
number support. Ordinary unsigned checks still accept all finite JSON floats.

## Local report writes

All inputs and target aliases (including existing hard links) are checked before
any write. --force permits replacing reports; its absence never overwrites a newly
created competing target. Each report stages beside its target, flushes/fsyncs, then
uses atomic replacement (--force) or hard-link publication (no force). Temporary
stages are cleaned after failure. The input and unrelated files remain untouched.
Multiple reports are not a transaction: a later export failure can leave an earlier
completed report. Atomic replacement requires filesystem support; unsupported
operations fail closed. This does not promise crash recovery or directory durability.
